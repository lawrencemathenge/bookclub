This is a project that imports pdf notes fro different mathematics topics.
Once the user selects the topic to study the pages are loaded to the websites to be read.
The user then selects pages by pages while using the right and left arrow to select next and previous pages respectively.
Using the DOM manipulation to select pages and event listeners for clicks.
Created a mock data base to handle the pdf files t the said topics.
The project mostly uses css (cascading styling sheets ) to designt the pages on the html structure.
